develop procedure:
1.Get the required materials(CAD or geber, bom list, schematic, tester config, special requirements such as device(CPLD/EEPROM) programming);
2.Transfer CAD to the board and board_xy files, and import the bom list to the board;
3.Edit the board and board_xy, search the test library for the device(write a setup test library for that can't get the suitable test library)
4.Adjust the tester config to suit your board(use the least pin card configuration according to the number of the test point);

Tips
1.Check if used the same strategy(testjet,presence,test library,silicon nail test, etc) for the devices have the same part number;
2.Check if the test probes of the Frequence Device(OSC,Crystal,XTAL,etc),Programming Device and Bscan Device are installed in the bottom side.
